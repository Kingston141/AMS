## 📌 About the Project

> **AMS** is an advanced AI-powered system for **automated surveillance, face recognition, and attendance marking** in schools and academies.  
It transforms traditional CCTV infrastructure into an intelligent, real-time attendance and monitoring system using **face embeddings + encrypted keys**, all handled **locally** without external databases.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎥 **Live Camera Feed Grid** (Webcam + IP/RTSP support)
- 🧠 **Real-Time Face Detection & Embedding Matching**
- 🔐 **Encrypted Key Generation for Each Face**
- 🧾 **Automated Attendance Logging**
- ⚠️ **Unknown Face Alerts**
- 🗂 **JSON-based Local Data Storage**
- 📊 **Dashboard with Tabs for Monitoring, Logs, and Settings**

    E[Live Camera Feed] --> F[Face Matcher];
    F --> G{Match Found?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Mark Attendance];
    G -- No --> I[Trigger Unknown Face Alert];
